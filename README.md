# Iris-Dataset
This assignment demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using the Iris dataset for a classification problem. The goal was to understand how instance-based learning works, specifically using KNN, and to evaluate how different values of K affect the model's performance and decision boundaries. The assignment was carried out using Python, with the help of key libraries such as Pandas for data handling, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for preprocessing and model building.
We started by loading and exploring the Iris dataset. The Id column was dropped as it held no predictive value, and the target variable Species was encoded into numeric format using LabelEncoder.
The KNN classifier was implemented using KNeighborsClassifier from Scikit-learn. We initially used K=5, evaluated the model's accuracy, and visualized the confusion matrix. We also generated a classification report to understand precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. For better interpretability, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the feature space to 2D and visualize the decision boundaries created by the KNN model.
The repository contains the Iris Dataset.ipynb file and Iris.csv dataset.
